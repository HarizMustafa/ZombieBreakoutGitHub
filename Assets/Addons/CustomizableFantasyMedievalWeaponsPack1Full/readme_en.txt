-----------------
Shader uses following textures:
* diffuse (textures without postfixes like arrow.tga) - alpha works for transparensy;
* normal map (textures with _n postfix like arrow_n.tga) - bump map;
* specular (textures with _s postfix like arrow_s.tga) - highlights map;
* glow (textures with _g postfix like arrow_g.tga) - emission map;
* reflection (textures with _r postfix like arrow_r.tga) - reflection map;
* cubemap - included in the pack;
* colorise (textures with _c postfix like arrow_c.tga) - colorise map.

There're also color settings:
* diffuse - diffuse color;
* specular - specular color;
* glow - emission color;
* 4-channel colorise color - color settings for colorise masks, located in RGBA channels of colorise texture. Color lays on white colored channel mask by multiply method.

You can also tune:
* glossiness - specular ray width;
* glowness - emission strength;
* reflectioness - reflection strength.
